            Mobile Site Analysis.

Mile High Comics.

A company by the name of Mile High Comics has one of the worst mobile sites that I have seen. The contrast on this site is just horrendous. There is no reasoning or theme behind the colors they chose. The lilac clashes with the black and makes the yellow headings stand out like a sore thumb; which draws away from the other words. Also the red announcement draws the eye away from the list of popular comic books that runs along the side in white print. As you scroll down the web page, the colors of the background change as well as the font type and size is changed. The comic book titles also clash with the background color and they are grouped together, which makes it hard to differentiate between the different titles.

Huffington Post.

When you open the Huffington Post mobile site, it is very easy to distinguish between the top news stories of the day and the occasional add that pops up as you scroll through. The titles of the multiple stories are easy to distinguish amongst one another because of the subtle dividing lines. Pictures that arenâ€™t outrageous and compliment the stories they are telling. The stories themselves are written in the same black font against a white background, which makes them easily readable and easy to navigate. They bring what seems to be the most up to date stories and the colors overall are simple but sophisticated.
